# News Analysis
In this notebook, we will analyze a dataset containing information about news articles. Our goal is to identify trends and anomalies that could help us understand what makes a news article potentially viral, i.e., get a lot of hits from readers.

## Steps
We will go through the following steps:

1. Load the data
2. Explore the data
3. Visualize the data
4. Identify trends and anomalies

Each step is important in our analysis. Loading the data is our starting point. Exploring the data helps us understand what information we have. Visualizing the data allows us to see patterns and relationships. Finally, identifying trends and anomalies gives us insights that we can use to tell a compelling story.
